            My name is Liam Sayers-Aho, I am a 25 year-old student returning for my second semester of IMD. I was born in Ottawa Ontario but have relatives in central and Northern Ontario. I spend a lot of my free time playing video games and hanging out with my girlfriend. I enjoy biking watching youtube. I enjoy watching how to prepare different cultural food and drink.  I enjoy traveling and have recently visited Las Vegas Nevada. I went to Ireland and England in 2019 with my family and got my first tattoo in Dublin. My favourite sites were the giant's causway and Newgrange neolithic site. I have one younger brother and we have two cats who are brothers. My cat is Smudge and he loves to sit in a box on my desk while I do school work and play games.
